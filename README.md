# Course Context: Artificial Intelligence Systems (СИИ)

This project is part of the academic discipline **"Artificial Intelligence Systems" (СисИскИ)** offered by the **Faculty of Software Engineering and Computer Technologies**.
The course is taught in **offline format** within the **Bachelor’s degree program**.

---

## Course Description

The discipline introduces key principles and methods used in the construction of intelligent systems.
Topics include:

* Resolution methods for goal-driven problem solving
* Techniques for building knowledge bases in AI systems
* Methods for reducing and optimizing search spaces in complex tasks

The course provides both theoretical background and practical tools for implementing intelligent decision-making systems.
